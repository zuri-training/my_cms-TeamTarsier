# Change Password/Password Reset

If you forgot your password, you can click on forgot password on the sign in page and it will take you to the forgot password page.&#x20;

You will be taken to a page where you will be required to input your registered email. The link to reset your password will be sent to your registered mail.



When you click on the link in the password reset email, it takes you to a page where you are required to input your new password. Afterwards, you're redirected to the login page where you can login with your new password that's just been setup.
