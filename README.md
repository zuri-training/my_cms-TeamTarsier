# Getting Started

My\_CMS is a platform that helps users build a basic website while allowing customization as much as possible.

(web-name) is a web application that gives users the power to build, customize, manage, and redesign website content without the need for in-depth technical knowledge. It is basically an all-in-one design platform that allows you to build a website without having to learn how to code or even write a single line of code from start. You  can use it to go from the initial idea to ready to use product.&#x20;

This application is made to let bloggers and companies that have little to no expertise constructing websites build their own websites, depending on the use case.

* Target Audience:
